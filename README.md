# ExceptionHandling
Exception handling is crucial in programming to manage run-time errors effectively. ASP.NET Core 8 provides enhanced capabilities for global exception handling, offering two distinct approaches: Custom Middleware and the IExceptionHandler interface.

 Custom Middleware and the IExceptionHandler interface introduced in .NET 8:


# Handling Global Exceptions in ASP.NET Core

## 1. Custom Middleware

One way to handle global exceptions in ASP.NET Core is through Custom Middleware. This involves creating a middleware component that catches exceptions globally and handles them appropriately. This middleware catches exceptions globally and provides a centralized place for handling them.

## 2. IExceptionHandler Interface (.NET 8)

In ASP.NET Core 8, the introduction of the `IExceptionHandler` interface offers another approach for handling global exceptions. This interface allows you to create a central class dedicated to exception handling. 

By implementing the `IExceptionHandler` interface, you create a centralized class for handling exceptions in ASP.NET Core 8.

These two approaches provide flexibility in managing global exceptions, allowing developers to choose the method that best fits their application's needs.
